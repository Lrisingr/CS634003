trends of the polls over time (by month)? Present visualization. Two different models (M1 and M2) to predict who is going to be the likely winner, including  preprocessing steps, predictors,
and the classification algorithm. Use the given dataset to augment it with ground truth and perform 5-fold cross validation. perform 5-fold cross validation and compute precision of M1 and M2.
Based on precision, does one of the models performs better than the other with 5% significance level?
