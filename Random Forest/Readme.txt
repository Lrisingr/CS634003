The data set contains plant lists from 246 nemoral forests in the Southern Finland. All 206 attributes are plant species. The data is confidential, and therefore the species corresponding to number codes
cannot be revealed.
1. Find the pattern of all plant species (i.e., ids) in the forests with support� threshold = 25%
2. Find  the max-frequent-plant species with the same support threshold.
3. Find  all the forest ids (first one is id 1, last one id 246 )� that have frequent plant species (with the same support threshold) of length 7 or more.
4. With a confidence threshold of 30% (and support threshold 25%), find out all association rules.
5. Find what is(are) the most uncommon maximum frequent pattern (With support threshold =25%) of plat species.
